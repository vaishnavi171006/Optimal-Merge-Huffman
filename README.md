# Huffman Coding using Greedy Algorithm in Java

This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a greedy algorithm used for lossless data compression. It builds a binary tree based on character frequencies and generates optimal prefix codes.

## 🚀 Features
- Constructs Huffman Tree using a priority queue
- Applies greedy strategy (Optimal Merge Pattern)
- Prints Huffman codes for given characters

## 📦 How to Run

### Compile
```bash
javac HuffmanCodingGreedy.java
